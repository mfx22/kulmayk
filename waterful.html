                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <font size="4"><p>
                          As we age, we begin to lose our sensation of thirst. Disorders such as Alzheimer's and Dementia can accentuate this feeling, leading thirst to cause headaches, severe cramping, and low pulse and blood pressure. The issue of dehydration is one of the largest issues among senior citizens - even scientific studies recognize this. Noll Physiological Research Center found that “31% of Long Term Care residents were dehydrated” and the UCLA School of Nursing found that adults older than 65 have the highest hospital admission rates for dehydration.

                        </p></font>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <font size="4"><p>
                          Waterfül aims to solve this problem by providing gentle yet effective reminders to drink water and making water more easily accessible to seniors.  The first half of the goal is done by utilizing a pumping system that pumps water from the bottom of the pitcher, through the handle, out of a narrow slit and back into the pitcher.  This creates a waterfall effect that mimics both the sound and sight of a real waterfall.  This reminder does not become annoying or patronizing the way a normal alarm does yet still demands attention.  It simulates an organic movement and creates action in the room - something we are drawn to natrually.  The latter half of the goal is accomplished through a pump system that allows the pump to be redirected to a spout.  This means that the user does not need to pick up the pitcher to pour water into their own mug.  They can simply turn the spout to get their water.

                        <h3> Empathy and Exploration </h3>

          <p>
            To begin exploring product ideas, our team started with empathy.  We started by calling our friends and family to discuss the everyday problems they observed and experienced.  With this learning, we tried to experience some of the pains expressed ourselves by dampening our senses and mobility for a day and trying to cook a meal together.  This put us in the shoes of the user and let us realize the emotional frustrations with some of these disabilities.  Next, we took to the streets of Ithaca to interact with the local elderly population and even visited several different assisted living centers to have more direct one-on-one conversations.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <div class="row">
              <img src="img/waterful/1.jpg" alt="" style="width:30%">
              <img src="img/waterful/2.jpg" alt="" style="width:30%">
              <img src="img/waterful/3.jpg" alt="" style="width:30%">
          </div>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>
            We took these experiences and created diagrams to better quantify our rather subjective data points.  This was done by mapping out the objective points from the interview and trying to extrapolaet underlying motives and desires from the experience.  This gave further insight on what needs and surprises we were able to draw from the user.  These needs, insights, and surprises were placed on colored post it notes for further classification.
          </p>

          <center><img src="img/waterful/interactions.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive" style="width:80%" /></center>

          <p>
            To make better sense of these emotional data points, we attempted to group them into categories, unmasking the overarching themes of what our users need. Lastly, we were able to arrive upon a flow of thoughts to encompass all of our findings into a smaller paragraph that could be used to derive a problem statement.
          </p>

          <p>
            With these findings fresh in our mind, our team jumped quickly into brainstorming.  We thought of over 70 different concepts to address these different pain points.  To narrow these ideas down, we used a Design Space Tradeoff Diagram in which we rated ideas as a team based on fasibility and desireability.  Our top three ideas ended up being an interaction-centric piece for assisted living centers, an expanding lip trash can, and a pitcher to tackle dehydration in seniors.  In the end, the water pitcher won out for its high feasibility and its potential to directly address one of the biggest problems in the elderly population.

          <h3> Market Analysis </h3>

          <p>
            Another large part of our project was determining the market potential, features, and user specifications for the product.  One useful tool to do this was conjoint analysis.  Conjoint analysis is a survey that asks users to compare different features of the product at various price points to determine the most desireable and important components of our product.  Our results revealed to us that price, stimuli, and assisted pouring were the top three areas that we needed to nail.  Furthermore, we also found that users would be willing to pay $50 and up to $100 for the product, setting a target for price for the pitcher.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to this, we also created a House of Quality diagram which outlines the functional requirements of our product and compares our product to competing products.
          </p>

          <center><img src="img/waterful/HOQ.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive" style="width:70%"></center>

          <p>
            The total household appliance market has been at a steady 3.9 Billion for several years while the smart water bottle industry has seen a recent surge in attention and sales.  We hope that if we can tap into just 3% of this market, we will be able to project over 3 million in sales.
          </p>

          <center><img src="img/waterful/market.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive" style="width:70%"></center>

          <p>
            Looking at competing products, we see that our pitcher distinguishes itself in three major ways.  First, no other competitors offer audio stimuli focusing mainly on phone notificaions and lights.  Secondly, most of these products are marketed towards the younger population while the older market remains mostly untapped.  Lastly, none of these devices offer any sort of assisted pouring, which our pitcher directly addresses.  These water bottles come at the $70 price point, making a $50 pitcher even more desireable based on price.
          </p>

          <h3> Prototyping </h3>

          <p>
            Our first prototype was developed with some existing materials.  We dremeled out an old Brita pitcher and made several 3D printed components for the rest of the enclosure.  The handle had tubing routed through it and the base housed the electronics, lights, and pumps.  There is also a power switch, button, and potentiometer to actuate the reminder system and tune settings for the intensity of lights and the frequency of reminders.
          </p>

          <center><img src="img/waterful/13.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive" style="width:80%"></center>
          <center><img src="img/waterful/14.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive" style="width:80%"></center>

          <p>
            With this first prototype built, we created a small demo video to show off its functionality and then began some testing with the prototype.  We brought it back to one of the assisted living centers and also had Theresa take it home for her grandparents to use for a few days.
          </p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <center><img src="img/waterful/15.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" style="width:30%"></center>


          <p>
            This gave us some very valuable feedback.  First, many found that it was a bit difficult to pour, though this is a problem among many objects as motor function begins to dwindle.  Secondly, the capacity of the water pitcher was a big deal, as a larger pitcher proved to be a bit overwhelming to users.  Lastly, there were concerns with the electronics being on the outside of the pitcher as they also seeemed to confuse many older users on what they were meant to do.
          </p>

          <p>
            These findings brought us into prototype 2.  To address the first problem, we added a spout integrated into the handle, taking advantage of the preexisting pump and the shape of the handle.  When the spout is actuated, the pump will transfer water through the spigot and into any container underneath the handle rather than waterfalling it back into the top of the pitcher.
          </p>
          <center><img src="img/waterful/handle.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive" style="width:30%"></center>

          <p>
            The second issue was addressed by  purchasing a slightly smaller and more sleek container as our starting component.  To make the controls more hidden away, we integrated a press-latch-lid into the base (similar to that found on a TV remote) that would give access to the tunable controls.  This ensures that caretakers can set the device to desireable settings and children would not easily be able to adjust any of the settings.  In addition, we also integrated a lid, pouring lip, and more stable base into the prototype.  These features and pictures are shown below.
